**Nearly 50 projects have now been developed. Many have grown and continue to operate**

Another edition of the Covid-19 Emergency Lab promoted by Silo - Arte e Latitude Rural [Art and Rural Latitude] reaches its end. We now have a total of 49 developed projects that propose solutions related to the crisis generated by the coronavirus pandemic. The initiatives are in fields such as science, education, technology, and art. They are geared mainly towards rural and peripheral areas. Around 700 people from across Brazil and other countries have participated in the Labs, including professionals from different backgrounds, organizers and community leaders. They worked collaboratively in an online environment with specialized mentoring. 

The Third Edition welcomed 11 new projects and was entitled Inflection: Strategies and New Narratives, a proposal to devise new forms of future from the disruption imposed by the pandemic. Four projects focused on solutions pertaining to agroecology and food systems. From Belo Horizonte, Circuito Cozinha, Campo e Mesa [Kitchen, Country & Table Circuit] connects cooks hit by the pandemic with local farmers in a single logistics network. The project Jornada do Alimento [The Food Journey] features a platform with content for consumers in the Greater São Paulo area who wish to access agrochemical-free food from small farmers. In Florianópolis, the project Peixaria Coletiva [Collective Fishmonger] proposes the creation of autonomous trade groups with residents and fishermen from the island. And from Rio de Janeiro we welcomed Cestas Cuidar-se [Care Baskets], a project born in the first edition of the Lab that returned with new proposals. The initiative delivers baskets with agroecological products for women who are in a vulnerable situation during the pandemic. 

New narratives arose for education also: Bonde da Gambiarra [The Kludge Squadron], from Rio de Janeiro, produces materials for schools intersecting knowledge on technology, science, and peripheral culture. Flora na Quarentena [Flora During Lockdown], another product of the first Emergency Lab, proposes a comic book filled with information for children on protection measures during the pandemic. And from an area known as Maciço do Baturité, in the state of Ceará, Oficina da Mata [The Woods Workshop] offers a platform that connects art education and agroecology initiatives located in the 12 cities that make up the region. 

Another platform developed was Integrasan, a website that gathers tutorials and educational materials with alternative solutions for basic sanitation. The team also offers online consultancy for those seeking solutions for their areas.

Finally, as a strategy for new possible futures, we have art. The project Aguapé, from Belo Horizonte, maps initiatives in the city and its metropolitan area and connects them with cultural agents. Another project developed was Museu Afeto e Memórias do Rincão da Chirca [Museum, Memories and Emotions of Rincão da Chirca], a different kind of digital museum that remembers the history of the Rincão da Chirca quilombo (communities founded by those who escaped enslavement in Brazil during colonial and post-colonial times) through the non-linear logic of oral traditions. Lastly, we have the project Curta Circuito [Short Circuit]: a wooden apparatus created to help solidarity groups in the transportation of donations, and that can be converted into a stage and urban structure for artistic and cultural performances.

Many projects continue to operate after the conclusion of the Lab. That's why the third edition also hosted Task Forces, an experiment with projects from the first and second editions. They came back to exchange ideas and experiences and help solve specific issues. Five projects were part of these Task Forces: Telas da Esperança [Screens of Hope], from Belém; Cestas Lúdicas [Playful Baskets], from Porto Alegre; Inclusive [Including], from Belo Horizonte; Incubadora de Sonhos [Dream Incubator], from Brasília; and Cartografias da Memória [Cartographies of Memory], from Rio de Janeiro. The Task Forces also functioned as a discussion space on the online methodology of the Lab. These are projects that, as others already developed in the Lab, have gained strength and expanded their work. An example is Cartografias da Memória, developed during the first edition. It is a sound map that seeks to document and preserve, through oral recounts, the memories of personal experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project is now supported by Open Society Foundations and managed by the Centre for Applied Human Rights at the University of York. Another example is Inclusive, which during the first Lab developed an autonomous network system for schools where the students have little or no access to the internet in their homes. Through this system, teachers can share content through a central computer and students can receive it on their devices even without access to cable or Wi-Fi internet. The project returned for the third edition of the Lab to develop a step-by-step installation guide and finalize the development of an installable disc image of a GNU/Linux system, aiming for a complete solution for online learning environments.

All projects at the Emergency Lab are developed through open technology and free licenses, with great replication potential. Complete documentation of all initiatives is available at the following website: [https://labdeemergencia.silo.org.br/](https://labdeemergencia.silo.org.br/){:target="_blank"}
