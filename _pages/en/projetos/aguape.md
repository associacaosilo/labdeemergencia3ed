The Aguapé project was born out of a desire to connect local cultural agents and territories in the Greater Belo Horizonte area that cultivate a connection to good living (**buen vivir**) in their relationship with the environment. Through dialogue and knowledge exchange we wish to generate partnerships and collaborations to showcase the stories and struggles of the people involved in the creation of each territory, community, and project, strengthening the oral narratives, memories, and images that emerge from their perspectives and relationships. Our intention is to boost the visibility of the multiple imaginaries and voices that form our city and to base our work on the real demands and needs of each space. Through the project and platform, we seek to listen to the voices of each territory, promoting more access to culture and merging artistic processes with the relations that emerge from working in the land.
  
**What was done** Through exchanges and collective construction with the collaborators and some territories of Belo Horizonte, we matured the idea behind Aguapé and, through conversations with some of the actors in the territories, we developed ways to start the project during this moment of social distancing. A web page was created to allow interested audiences to know more about the project and get in touch with it.
￼￼￼
**Next steps** We will continue to mature Aguapé by continuing the preliminary dialogue with the territories and expanding our contact with the actors in them and with cultural agents through several means, as well as searching and reaching out to similar projects in the greater Belo Horizonte area. We will also continue to work on the structure and logistics of the virtual platform, given that some of the collaborators have expressed their desire to stay in the project.
