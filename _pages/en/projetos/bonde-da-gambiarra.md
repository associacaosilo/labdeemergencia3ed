Bonde da Gambiarra is an initiative focused on education and geared towards broadening the concept of technology. It adopts the kludge (**gambiarra**) as a process to build technology based on the STES approach (Science, Technology, Environment, Society), which mixes decision-making with social responsibility, critical reflection, rational thinking and problem-solving capacities.
  
The proposal during the Lab was to develop an interdisciplinary methodology based on the kludge as improvisation, understanding it as a way of life that sustains an active attitude towards the world. The proposal takes on the strategy of hacking technology to appropriate itself of it, in addition to making the students the protagonists of the educational process, above all considering the kludge as a product of creativity, a powerful device to build affection during the educational process.
  
The main result of the Lab is a transformation of Bonde da Gambiarra into a platform of open projects focused on primary and secondary school. It encourages FIGURE-IT-OUT-OLOGY (THE ART OF FIGURING IT OUT) as a pillar to produce contents and proposals of activities that will be made available through the Instagram page [@bondeda_gambiarra](https://www.instagram.com/bondeda_gambiarra/){:target="_blank"} and in a library for educators and students. The first content to be released after the Lab is a presentation of the concepts of the research developed during the process and the kludge proposals devised by the team.
  
The next steps are to use the examples proposed by the team for the production of content for social media and the library, also inviting the audience to collaborate and create their own kludge.
