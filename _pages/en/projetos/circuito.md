Circuito cozinha, campo, mesa​ begins by identifying and mapping cooks who were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The mapping is done through a website and intends to give visibility to the professionals who registered to it, also functioning as a network for fraternizing and gathering. This visibility will be the starting point to reflect on and regenerate the relationship between these professionals and the ASCs (Agriculture-Supporting Communities) closest to them. Following the closing of restaurants and the decrease in foot traffic, many cooks have been improvising at home with no direct contact with their clients and lacking logistical support to channel their production. The idea we are developing is that, through this mapping, a solidarity network will be developed between cooks and ASCs. By having access to produce (fruits, vegetables, etc.), the cooks will be able to produce meals, snacks, preserves, etc. and include them in some way in the produce baskets sold by the farmers - or develop other sales arrangements. This will create the opportunity of working with poison-free food that generates income and stability for farming families, as well as introduce the work of these cooks into an already existing network that is open to dialogue.
