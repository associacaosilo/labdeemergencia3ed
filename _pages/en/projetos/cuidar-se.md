This initiative aims to strengthen and disseminate self care actions among the women who form the Agroecology Alliance of Rio de Janeiro. These women have spearheaded a number of community and solidarity efforts and play a key role in the circulation of information, prevention measures, and demands for health, food, and education rights in their territories.
  
We have been delivering Care Baskets with community health practices, protection measures, and brochures. The products distributed are made by women farmers, therapists, homeopaths, and popular communicators who also form the Alliance. This gives them an economic boost in a moment when the economic crisis has been impacting many areas, particularly the lives of women, many of whom are the head of their family.
