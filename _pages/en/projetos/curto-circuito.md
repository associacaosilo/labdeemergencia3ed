In light of the growing social organizing to mitigate the impact of the health crisis, we felt an urgency to strengthen exchange systems, promote the distribution of essential goods, and democratize access to culture, leisure, knowledge, and information. The project aims to help volunteers as they collect, store and share cultural and social goods and actions. A brochure was developed with a step-by-step guide to build a **Camoca**, an itinerant object that can be used to transfer donations and promote cultural actions. Its design allows it to be attached to a bike or pushed as a wheel cart.
