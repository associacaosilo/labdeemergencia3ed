Flora na Quarentena - e a sonhada volta às aulas ​is a series of educational comic books with the goal of sharing information on the Covid-19 pandemic as well as critically analyzing the current scenario. While there is plenty of scientific material circulating on the web, there is a shortage of verified contents that propose a different kind of dialogue, particularly with children. In addition, the potential reopening of schools would demand the production of quality material to guide both parents and students. In an effort to boost the educational aspect of the project, we propose the production of a magazine annexed to the Flora comic books with a range of playful, informative activities suggesting how to react to different situations.
  
While many scientific materials on the coronavirus have been circulating from the beginning of the pandemic, only a small fraction of them engage with children. With the goal of sharing relevant information on many issues associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, we developed the magazine **Flora na Quarentena - e a sonhada volta às aulas**. It features comic strips filled with science and tenderness, as well as a series of educational activities and games developed for children in primary education. The main proposal of the magazine is to invite children to imagine a future where the return to school is a reality and certain protection measures must be taken to preserve everyone's health.
