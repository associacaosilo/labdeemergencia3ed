Museu, Memórias e Afetos do Rincão da Chirca​ will be a website gathering documents, texts, and pictures portraying the oral history of a countryside region in the city of Rosário do Sul. These documents, gathered over years by the proponent, have been based on recounts of local oral traditions. The website will function as a space to safeguard this memory and, following the conclusion of the project, will be open to new research documents.

  
The goal of our project is the constitution of a digital museum of Quilombo Rincão da Chirca, in the **pampa** region of Rio Grande do Sul. **Quilombos** are communities founded by those who escaped enslavement in Brazil during colonial and post-colonial times. The narrative concept seeks connection to oral traditions, allowing nonlinear navigation through contents that are not sorted by a menu. During the week, we worked on the strategies described below:

1. research and identification of the specific words / contents that will lead the narrative;
2. reflecting on the relationships between these words / contents and establishing a visual map;
3. production of documents (images, videos, audios, texts);
4. developing and designing the environment of the website through a first set of contents
named Maria Espiga. Our next steps are the purchase of a domain, developing the website and producing the other contents that will form the museum.
