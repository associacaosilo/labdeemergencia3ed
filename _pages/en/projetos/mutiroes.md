## INCLUSIVE /Belo Horizonte, MG
  
The project **Inclusive | Redes Comunitárias para Ambientes Virtuais de Aprendizagem ("Including | Community Networks for Digital Learning Environment")** has the goal of developing an autonomous network system to share didactic materials through text, audio, and video, as well as popularizing this methodology so it can be applied in communities with a shortage of connection resources and undergoing social isolation. A brochure was also created on the concept and implementation of the system. A low-cost solution was developed to implement a local media server where contents can be added and made available for the local community through a wireless network accessible by cell phone or computer. The network is managed by the community itself, its entire structure is based on free software, and it works independently from an internet connection. A system was created in the previous edition of the Lab; to make it operational, **Inclusive** aims to develop a step-by-step installation guide and finalize the development of an installable disk image for GNU/Linux systems as a complete solution for Virtual Learning Environments.

<img src="/3ed/media/images/incubadora.png" width="50%" padding-left="20%">

The project supports students primarily, motivating them to reflect on the current scenario in which the challenges caused by Covid-19 must be faced and to picture dreams for the future that can foster the emergence of collaborative projects in their communities.
During the Third Edition of the Covid-19 Emergency Lab, **Incubadora de Sonhos** developed materials and strategies for **Campanha Sonho Jovem** ("Youth Dream Campaign"), which seeks to inspire young people from across the country to express and chase their dreams.
The following activities were carried out:
* mobilizing young people to contribute to the Campaign;
* developing application forms for the main gathering and for the submission of videos;
* youth gathering with theater exercised and a reading of the poem Sonho Jovem ("Young
Dream");
* creating a user manual for Instagram;
* developing the layout for Campanha Sonho Jovem on Instagram;
* developing an implementation strategy for Campanha Sonho Jovem on Instagram;
* creating a logo for Incubadora de Sonhos;
* collecting videos in which young people express their dreams;
* editing the Sonho Jovem video.
The next steps are the launch and implementation of Campanha Sonho Jovem on social media.

## CARTOGRAPHY OF MEMORIES / Rio de Janeiro, RJ
  
**Cartografia das Memórias** is a sound map created through a collaborative initiative that seeks to document and preserve, through oral recounts, the memories of personal experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. You can collaborate by sending your testimonial and also by sharing the project with your contacts. We wish to reach the highest possible number and diversity of testimonials to create a heterogeneous set of viewpoints on this global-scale event. Currently, the main goal of the project is to be publicized in different parts of the country and to develop communication tactics in order to produce contents that are capable of connecting people to the project and encouraging them to send their own testimonials.

## TELAS DA ESPERANÇA /Belém, PA
  
**Screens of Hope**
Telas em Movimento ("Moving Screens") is a peripheral film festival in the Amazon. Led by people from the peripheries, it seeks to democratize access to film. In light of the pandemic, the project redirected its actions to fighting Covid-19. This year, hundreds of families in peripheral neighborhoods and riverside communities of Belém were benefited through the mobilization of public health agents, community awareness campaigns, and the distribution of food and hygiene kits, masks, and an educational drawing kit named ​Telas da Esperança​ ("Screens of Hope"). Based on the drawings made by the children during the first step of the project,​ Telas da Esperança​ is now searching for people to animate them and create a communication campaign. These animations will be presented later, during the online edition of the festival.

## CESTAS LÚDICAS /Porto Alegre, RS
  
**Playful Baskets**
The project Cestas Lúdicas e Didáticas ("Playful and Educational Baskets") aims to reach women in vulnerable areas both during and after the pandemic who are facing difficulties to carry out play and education activities with their children. The proposal is to create moments where the children and their mothers can decompress through playful, educational activities that can also be used in local schools and daycare centers. Based on the proposal of local action, the project builds on a previously existing initiative that has been assisting vulnerable communities in the city of Porto Alegre during the pandemic. This allows us to understand the immediate situation of these women and offer solutions that fit their needs. Now, Cestas Lúdicas seeks to develop new communication strategies, develop a website and publish a collection of all zines created by the group so far.
