The peixaria.coletiva project began during the pandemic by seeking new forms of communication that favor the commercialization of artisanal fishery and also prompt the dissemination of knowledge on its current legislation.
  
Since 2017 in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, a project called Responsible Consumer Cells (RCCs) has been developed by the Laboratory of Commercialization of Family Farming at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (LACAF/UFSC, as per the acronym in Portuguese). it connects groups of agroecological farmers to final consumers through collective purchases.
  
Our main goal during the Emergency Lab was to develop a similar system for RCCs geared towards artisanal fishery, making use of the digital communication means that these communities already access and contributing to the establishment of a broader network of contacts. In addition to defining the main guidelines of the project, naming it, and working on its visual identity, we have established parameters for the development of a pilot edition. We are already in touch with a community of fishermen and mariculturists and have been forming a group of people interested in purchasing from them.
  
Over time, our intention is to develop a digital platform exclusive for this project, which we intend to do alongside the fishing communities. The platform will serve to share recipes, curious facts, maps, laws, and other documentation that will help us preserve the material and immaterial heritage of artisanal fishery in Florianópolis.
