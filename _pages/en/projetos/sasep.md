INTEGRASAN - Integrating by Democratizing Information on Sanitation
￼
The proposal behind the **Integrasan** project is to offer online consultancy services and quality information to assist in the implementation of alternative basic sanitation technologies, preferably low-cost and easily operable, ideal for small, isolated communities who lack infrastructure. The consultancy will take place through an online interactive platform where anyone can register and report on the reality of their community, later receiving a diagnosis of the current situation and a set of alternative, tried-and-true technologies. Another path is to create and offer technical brochures with understandable and easily accomplished instructions for different aspects of basic sanitation.
